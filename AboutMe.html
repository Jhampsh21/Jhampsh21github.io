            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jack Hampshire and I'm a British basketyball player. I've been playing basketball since I was 10 years old and 
			and i've been lucky enough to compete in many different countries. I've played in countries such as America, Serbia, England and Lithuania. 
			I refer to myself as an underdog because throughout my career I've experinced more failures than successes. Many of my coaches, teammates and other persons 
			have tried to encourage me that I will go nowhere in basketball nor shall i have any success within the sport. Possessing a relentless mentality has helped me to push myself beyond my limits and 
			drowned out any critics and all the noise that goes against my dreams and goals as an athlete. Overall, I am a person who is hard working, dedicated and diciplined 
			in achieveing what I've set out to achieved despite the obstacles that stand in my way.</p>
