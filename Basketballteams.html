            <h1>Basketball Teams</h1>
            <p>The city of Leeds basketball team was my first basketball program throughout all of high school and college. This club taught me the simple fundamentals 
			of basketball and how the game is structured as a whole. My skills along with my IQ increased rapidly and I became a fundamentally sound player throughout my high schools 
			years. Eventaully making me become the MVP (Most Valuable Player) during my final year of high school. I then remained in the program through my college years by competeing 
			in the ABL (Academic basketball league).</p>
			
			<p>After my career at the city of leeds basketball team had ended. I was granted a scholarship to go play basketball over in New York for the Hoosac basketball
			team. This is where my game developed much higher. As a postgraduate, I was taking part in three practises a day, playing a large number of games against some of the best teams
			and players in the nation. However, my individual skill level did not prosper enough to place me in the starting line up. Despite, my insane work ethic and drive, it wasnt enough to give me 
			playing time on the court. As a result, I didnt recieve any scholarship from any American Universitities.</p>
			
			<p>Now I am committed at LCC international University in Lithuania playing for the LCC Moose basketball mens team where I'm still needing to prove myself each and everyday. I am currently on the 2nd team roster, but I desire to be on the first team, despite the criticise I get from my coaches and teammates. Throughout my journey I've realised something, I will 
			always, no matter where I go, be put in a situation where I will always need to prove myself and earn my spot on the court. This is something I will not shy away from . I will still push forward and one day soon, my place will be 
			earned.</p>
